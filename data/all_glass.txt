All cold drinks in bars and restaurants are sold in glasses with a calibration mark ("Eichstrich") that is frequently checked by the "Eichamt" (~ Bureau of Weights and Measures) to ensure the guest is getting as much as is offered in the menu Tomatoes, lettuce, broad beans, onions, and cucumbers are grown in the eastern portion of the region near Jena under glass centers on about of land Though Cleveland appointed no black Americans to patronage jobs, he allowed Frederick Douglass to continue in his post as recorder of deeds in Washington, D and appointed another black man (James Campbell Matthews, a former New York judge) to replace Douglass upon his resignation His decision to replace Douglass with a black man was met with outrage, but Cleveland claimed to have known Matthews personally Coudert, but Cleveland acquiesced in an inoffensive choice, that of Senator Edward Douglass White of Louisiana, whose nomination was accepted unanimously A Gothic Revival edifice which was built by hand from 1861 to 1888 under French direction, its original Latin and French stained-glass windows were destroyed during the wars and amid the Cultural Revolution; they have since been replaced by English ones
The Time Lords' principal city, named The Capitol, comprises shining towers protected by a mighty glass dome
The planet makes its first appearance in the revived series in "The Sound of Drums" (2007), where the Citadel, enclosed in a glass dome (as described by the Doctor in "Gridlock", 2007), is seen in flashback as the Doctor describes it These bars are made of fiberglass covered in wood laminate, to prevent them from breaking8Â cm thick steel or fiberglass bar raised 2 The two designs differed; Davy's lamp was surrounded by a screen of gauze, whereas Stephenson's prototype lamp had a perforated plate contained in a glass cylinder
Chesterfield Museum in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, has a gallery of Stephenson memorabilia, including straight thick glass tubes he invented for growing straight cucumbers The most familiar, and historically the oldest, types of manufactured glass are "silicate glasses" based on the chemical compound silica (silicon dioxide, or quartz), the primary constituent of sand The term "glass", in popular usage, is often used to refer only to this type of material, which is familiar from use as window glass and in glass bottles Of the many silica-based glasses that exist, ordinary glazing and container glass is formed from a specific type called soda-lime glass, composed of approximately 75% silicon dioxide (SiO2), sodium oxide (Na2O) from sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), calcium oxide (CaO), also called lime, and several minor additives
Many applications of silicate glasses derive from their optical transparency, giving rise to their primary use as window panes Glass will transmit, reflect and refract light; these qualities can be enhanced by cutting and polishing to make optical lenses, prisms, fine glassware, and optical fibers for high speed data transmission by light These qualities have led to the extensive use of glass in the manufacture of art objects and in particular, stained glass windows Although brittle, silicate glass is extremely durable, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures Because glass can be formed or moulded into any shape, it has been traditionally used for vessels: bowls, vases, bottles, jars and drinking glasses When extruded as glass fiber and matted as glass wool in a way to trap air, it becomes a thermal insulating material, and when these glass fibers are embedded into an organic polymer plastic, they are a key structural reinforcement part of the composite material fiberglass Some objects historically were so commonly made of silicate glass that they are simply called by the name of the material, such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses
Scientifically, "glass" is often defined in a broader sense, encompassing every solid that possesses a non-crystalline (that is, amorphous) structure at the atomic scale and that exhibits a glass transition when heated towards the liquid state Porcelains and many polymer thermoplastics familiar from everyday use are glasses These sorts of glasses can be made of quite different kinds of materials than silica: metallic alloys, ionic melts, aqueous solutions, molecular liquids, and polymers For many applications, like glass bottles or eyewear, polymer glasses (acrylic glass, polycarbonate or polyethylene terephthalate) are a lighter alternative than traditional glass
Silicate glass
Silicon dioxide (SiO2) is a common fundamental constituent of glass
Fused quartz is a glass made from chemically-pure silica One is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, "soda"), which lowers the glass-transition temperature The soda makes the glass water-soluble, which is usually undesirable, so lime (CaO, calcium oxide, generally obtained from limestone), some magnesium oxide (MgO) and aluminium oxide (Al2O3) are added to provide for a better chemical durability The resulting glass contains about 70 to 74% silica by weight and is called a soda-lime glass Soda-lime glasses account for about 90% of manufactured glass
Most common glass contains other ingredients to change its properties Lead glass or flint glass is more "brilliant" because the increased refractive index causes noticeably more specular reflection and increased optical dispersion Thorium oxide gives glass a high refractive index and low dispersion and was formerly used in producing high-quality lenses, but due to its radioactivity has been replaced by lanthanum oxide in modern eyeglasses Iron can be incorporated into glass to absorb infrared radiation, for example in heat-absorbing filters for movie projectors, while cerium(IV) oxide can be used for glass that absorbs ultraviolet wavelengths
The following is a list of the more common types of silicate glasses and their ingredients, properties, and applications:
Another common glass ingredient is crushed alkali glass or 'cullet' ready for recycled glass The recycled glass saves on raw materials and energy Fining agents such as sodium sulfate, sodium chloride, or antimony oxide may be added to reduce the number of air bubbles in the glass mixture Glass batch calculation is the method by which the correct raw material mixture is determined to achieve the desired glass composition
Glass is in widespread use largely due to the production of glass compositions that are transparent to visible light The surface of a glass is often smooth since during glass formation the molecules of the supercooled liquid are not forced to dispose in rigid crystal geometries and can follow surface tension, which imposes a microscopically smooth surface These properties, which give glass its clearness, can be retained even if glass is partially light-absorbing, i Common glass has a refraction index around 1 This may be modified by adding low-density materials such as boron, which lowers the index of refraction (see crown glass), or increased (to as much as 18) with high-density materials such as (classically) lead oxide (see flint glass and lead glass), or in modern uses, less toxic oxides of zirconium, titanium, or barium These high-index glasses (inaccurately known as "crystal" when used in glass vessels) cause more chromatic dispersion of light, and are prized for their diamond-like optical properties
According to Fresnel equations, the reflectivity of a sheet of glass is about 4% per surface (at normal incidence in air), and the transmissivity of one element (two surfaces) is about 90%
In the manufacturing process, silicate glass can be poured, formed, extruded and molded into forms ranging from flat sheets to highly intricate shapes
Although glass is generally corrosion-resistant and more corrosion resistant than other materials, it still can be corroded The materials that make up a particular glass composition have an effect on how quickly the glass corrodes A glass containing a high proportion of alkalis or alkali earths is less corrosion-resistant than other kinds of glasses
Glass typically has a tensile strength of , however theoretically it can have a strength of due to glass's strong chemical bonds Several factors such as imperfections like scratches and bubbles and the glass's chemical composition impact the tensile strength of glass Several processes such as toughening can increase the strength of glass
Following the glass batch preparation and mixing, the raw materials are transported to the furnace Soda-lime glass for mass production is melted in gas fired units Smaller scale furnaces for specialty glasses include electric melters, pot furnaces, and day tanks
After melting, homogenization and refining (removal of bubbles), the glass is  Flat glass for windows and similar applications is formed by the float glass process, developed between 1953 and 1957 by Sir Alastair Pilkington and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UK's Pilkington Brothers, who created a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten tin bath on which the molten glass flows unhindered under the influence of gravity The top surface of the glass is subjected to nitrogen under pressure to obtain a polished finish
Container glass for common bottles and jars is formed by blowing and pressing methods This glass is often slightly modified chemically (with more alumina and calcium oxide) for greater water resistance Further glass forming techniques are summarized in the table 
Once the desired form is obtained, glass is usually annealed for the removal of stresses and to increase the glass's hardness and durability
Surface treatments, coatings or lamination may follow to improve the chemical durability (glass container coatings, glass container internal treatment), strength (toughened glass, bulletproof glass, windshields), or optical properties (insulated glazing, anti-reflective coating)
Color in glass may be obtained by addition of electrically charged ions (or color centers) that are homogeneously distributed, and by precipitation of finely dispersed particles (such as in photochromic glasses)
Ordinary soda-lime glass appears colorless to the naked eye when it is thin, although iron(II) oxide (FeO) impurities of up to 0 Sulfur, together with carbon and iron salts, is used to form iron polysulfides and produce amber glass ranging from yellowish to almost black A glass melt can also acquire an amber color from a reducing combustion atmosphere Art glass and studio glass pieces are colored using closely guarded recipes that involve specific combinations of metal oxides, melting temperatures and "cook" times Most colored glass used in the art market is manufactured in volume by vendors who serve this market, although there are some glassmakers with the ability to make their own color from raw materials
History of silicate glass
Naturally occurring glass, especially the volcanic glass obsidian, was used by many Stone Age societies across the globe for the production of sharp cutting tools and, due to its limited source areas, was extensively traded Archaeological evidence suggests that the first true glass was made in coastal north Syria, Mesopotamia or ancient Egypt The earliest known glass objects, of the mid third millennium BCE, were beads, perhaps initially created as accidental by-products of metal-working (slags) or during the production of faience, a pre-glass vitreous material made by a process similar to glazing
Glass remained a luxury material, and the disasters that overtook Late Bronze Age civilizations seem to have brought glass-making to a halt Indigenous development of glass technology in South Asia may have begun in 1730 BCE In ancient China, though, glassmaking seems to have a late start, compared to ceramics and metal work The term "glass" developed in the late Roman Empire It was in the Roman glassmaking center at Trier, now in modern Germany, that the late-Latin term "glesum" originated, probably from a Germanic word for a transparent, lustrous substance Examples of Roman glass have been found outside of the former Roman Empire in China, the Baltics, the Middle East and India Anglo-Saxon glass has been found across England during archaeological excavations of both settlement and cemetery sites From the 10th-century onwards, glass was employed in stained glass windows of churches and cathedrals, with famous examples at Chartres Cathedral and the Basilica of Saint Denis By the 14th-century, architects were designing buildings with walls of stained glass such as Sainte-Chapelle, Paris, (1203â1248) and the East end of Gloucester Cathedral Stained glass had a major revival with Gothic Revival architecture in the 19th century With the Renaissance, and a change in architectural style, the use of large stained glass windows became less prevalent The use of domestic stained glass increased until most substantial houses had glass windows These were initially small panes leaded together, but with the changes in technology, glass could be manufactured relatively cheaply in increasingly larger sheets
In the 20th century, new types of glass such as laminated glass, reinforced glass and glass bricks increased the use of glass as a building material and resulted in new applications of glass Multi-story buildings are frequently constructed with curtain walls made almost entirely of glass Similarly, laminated glass has been widely applied to vehicles for windscreens Optical glass for spectacles has been used since the Middle Ages
From the 19th century, there was a revival in many ancient glass-making techniques including cameo glass, achieved for the first time since the Roman Empire and initially mostly used for pieces in a neo-classical style The Art Nouveau movement made great use of glass, with RenÃ© Lalique, Ãmile GallÃ©, and Daum of Nancy producing colored vases and similar pieces, often in cameo glass, and also using luster techniques Louis Comfort Tiffany in America specialized in stained glass, both secular and religious, and his famous lamps The early 20th-century saw the large-scale factory production of glass art by firms such as Waterford and Lalique From about 1960 onwards, there have been an increasing number of small studios hand-producing glass artworks, and glass artists began to class themselves as in effect sculptors working in glass, and their works as part fine arts
In the 21st century, scientists observe the properties of ancient stained glass windows, in which suspended nanoparticles prevent UV light from causing chemical reactions that change image colors, are developing photographic techniques that use similar stained glass to capture true color images of Mars for the 2019 ESA Mars Rover mission
New chemical glass compositions or new treatment techniques can be initially investigated in small-scale laboratory experiments The raw materials for laboratory-scale glass melts are often different from those used in mass production because the cost factor has a low priority Evaporation losses during glass melting should be considered during the selection of the raw materials, e Glass homogeneity is achieved by homogenizing the raw materials mixture (glass batch), by stirring the melt, and by crushing and re-melting the first melt The obtained glass is usually annealed to prevent breakage during processing
To make glass from materials with poor glass forming tendencies, novel techniques are used to increase cooling rate, or reduce crystal nucleation triggers
Fiberglass
Fiberglass (also called glass-reinforced-plastic) is a composite material made up of glass fibers (also called fiberglass or glass friller) embedded in a plastic resin It is made by melting glass and stretching the glass into fibers
Fiberglass filaments are made through a pultrusion process in which the raw materials (sand, limestone, kaolin clay, fluorspar, colemanite, dolomite and other minerals) are melted in a large furnace into a liquid which is extruded through very small orifices (5â25 micrometres in diameter if the glass is E-glass and 9 micrometers if the glass is S-glass)
Fiberglass has the properties of being lightweight and corrosion resistant Fiberglass is also a good insulator, allowing it to be used to insulate buildings Most fiberglasses are not alkali resistant Fiberglass also has the property of becoming stronger as the glass ages
Network glasses
Some types of glass that do not include silica as a major constituent may have physico-chemical properties useful for their application in fiber optics and other specialized technical applications These include fluoride glass, aluminate and aluminosilicate glass, phosphate glass, borate glass, and chalcogenide glass
There are three classes of components for oxide glass: network formers, intermediates, and modifiers The intermediates (titanium, aluminium, zirconium, beryllium, magnesium, zinc) can act as both network formers and modifiers, according to the glass composition The modifiers (calcium, lead, lithium, sodium, potassium) alter the network structure; they are usually present as ions, compensated by nearby non-bridging oxygen atoms, bound by one covalent bond to the glass network and holding one negative charge to compensate for the positive ion nearby
The alkali metal ions are small and mobile; their presence in glass allows a degree of electrical conductivity, especially in molten state or at high temperature Their mobility decreases the chemical resistance of the glass, allowing leaching by water and facilitating corrosion The most common commercial glass types contain both alkali and alkaline earth ions (usually sodium and calcium), for easier processing and satisfying corrosion resistance Corrosion resistance of glass can be increased by dealkalization, removal of the alkali ions from the glass surface by reaction with sulfur or fluorine compounds Presence of alkaline metal ions has also detrimental effect to the loss tangent of the glass, and to its electrical resistance; glass manufactured for electronics (sealing, vacuum tubes, lampsÂ  Lead oxide also facilitates solubility of other metal oxides and is used in colored glass The viscosity decrease of lead glass melt is very significant (roughly 100 times in comparison with soda glass); this allows easier removal of bubbles and working at lower temperatures, hence its frequent use as an additive in vitreous enamels and glass solders The high ionic radius of the Pb2+ ion renders it highly immobile in the matrix and hinders the movement of other ions; lead glasses therefore have high electrical resistance, about two orders of magnitude higher than soda-lime glass (108 For more details, see lead glass
Addition of fluorine lowers the dielectric constant of glass High levels of fluorine doping lead to formation of volatile SiF2O and such glass is then thermally unstable Klement at Caltech, who showed that cooling rates on the order of millions of degrees per second is sufficient to impede the formation of crystals, and the metallic atoms become "locked into" a glassy state These are known as bulk metallic glasses (BMG)
In 2004, NIST researchers presented evidence that an isotropic non-crystalline metallic phase (dubbed "q-glass") could be grown from the melt Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show that the q-glass nucleates from the melt as discrete particles, which grow spherically with a uniform growth rate in all directions The diffraction pattern shows it to be an isotropic glassy phase Yet there is a nucleation barrier, which implies an interfacial discontinuity (or internal surface) between the glass and the melt In a mixture of three or more ionic species of dissimilar size and shape, crystallization can be so difficult that the liquid can easily be supercooled into a glass Glass electrolytes in the form of Ba-doped Li-glass and Ba-doped Na-glass have been proposed as solutions to problems identified with organic liquid electrolytes used in modern lithium-ion battery cells
Some aqueous solutions can be supercooled into a glassy state, for instance LiCl:"R"H2O (a solution of lithium chloride salt and water molecules) in the composition range 4<"R"<8 An aqueous solution containing sugar has a glassy state and can be used as a surfactant
Many molecular liquids can be supercooled into a glass; some are excellent glass formers that normally do not crystallize
An example of this is sugar glass
Important polymer glasses include amorphous and glassy pharmaceutical compounds
Colloidal glasses
Concentrated colloidal suspensions may exhibit a distinct glass transition as function of particle concentration or density
In cell biology, there is recent evidence suggesting that the cytoplasm behaves like a colloidal glass approaching the liquid-glass transition
Glass-ceramic materials share many properties with both non-crystalline glass and crystalline ceramics They are formed as a glass, and then partially crystallized by heat treatment Thus, glass-ceramics have become extremely useful for countertop cooking The negative thermal expansion coefficient (CTE) of the crystalline ceramic phase can be balanced with the positive CTE of the glassy phase At a certain point (~70% crystalline) the glass-ceramic has a net CTE near zero This type of glass-ceramic exhibits excellent mechanical properties and can sustain repeated and quick temperature changes up to 1000Â Â°C
As in other amorphous solids, the atomic structure of a glass lacks the long-range periodicity observed in crystalline solids Due to chemical bonding characteristics, glasses do possess a high degree of short-range order with respect to local atomic polyhedra
In physics, the standard definition of a glass (or vitreous solid) is a solid formed by rapid melt quenching, although the term glass is often used to describe any amorphous solid that exhibits a glass transition temperature Tg The tendency for a material to form a glass while quenched is called glass-forming ability Generally, a glass exists in a structurally metastable state with respect to its crystalline form, although in certain circumstances, for example in atactic polymers, there is no crystalline analogue of the amorphous phase
Glass is sometimes considered to be a liquid due to its lack of a first-order phase transition
where certain thermodynamic variables such as volume, entropy and enthalpy are discontinuous through the glass transition range The glass transition may be described as analogous to a second-order phase transition where the intensive thermodynamic variables such as the thermal expansivity and heat capacity are discontinuous Nonetheless, the equilibrium theory of phase transformations does not entirely hold for glass, and hence the glass transition cannot be classed as one of the classical equilibrium phase transformations in solids The notion that glass flows to an appreciable extent over extended periods of time is not supported by empirical research or theoretical analysis (see viscosity of amorphous materials) Laboratory measurements of room temperature glass flow do show a motion consistent with a material viscosity on the order of 1017â1018 Pa s
Although the atomic structure of glass shares characteristics of the structure in a supercooled liquid, glass tends to behave as a solid below its glass transition temperature The change in heat capacity at a glass transition and a melting transition of comparable materials are typically of the same order of magnitude, indicating that the change in active degrees of freedom is comparable as well Both in a glass and in a crystal it is mostly only the vibrational degrees of freedom that remain active, whereas rotational and translational motion is arrested
Behavior of antique glass
The observation that old windows are sometimes found to be thicker at the bottom than at the top is often offered as supporting evidence for the view that glass flows over a timescale of centuries, the assumption being that the glass has exhibited the liquid property of flowing from one shape to another This assumption is incorrect, as once solidified, glass stops flowing The reason for the observation is that in the past, when panes of glass were commonly made by glassblowers, the technique used was to spin molten glass so as to create a round, mostly flat and even plate (the crown glass process, described above) The pieces were not absolutely flat; the edges of the disk became a different thickness as the glass spun When installed in a window frame, the glass would be placed with the thicker side down both for the sake of stability and to prevent water accumulating in the lead cames at the bottom of the window Occasionally, such glass has been found installed with the thicker side at the top, left or right
Mass production of glass window panes in the early twentieth century caused a similar effect In glass factories, molten glass was poured onto a large cooling table and allowed to spread The resulting glass is thicker at the location of the pour, located at the center of the large sheet Modern glass intended for windows is produced as float glass and is very uniform in thickness
Several other points can be considered that contradict the "cathedral glass flow" theory: Soft tissue is not cut by the laserâs beam, but is instead cut by contact with a hot charred glass tip
All the stained glass in the cathedral dates from its rebuilding in the 19th and 20th centuries The last room is decorated in black and is illuminated by a scarlet light, "a deep blood color" cast from its stained glass windowsStained glass

The term stained glass can refer to coloured glass as a material or to works created from it Although traditionally made in flat panels and used as windows, the creations of modern stained glass artists also include three-dimensional structures and sculpture Modern vernacular usage has often extended the term "stained glass" to include domestic lead light and objects d'art created from foil glasswork exemplified in the famous lamps of Louis Comfort Tiffany
As a material "stained glass" is glass that has been coloured by adding metallic salts during its manufacture The coloured glass is crafted into "stained glass windows" in which small pieces of glass are arranged to form patterns or pictures, held together (traditionally) by strips of lead and supported by a rigid frame The term "stained glass" is also applied to windows in which the colours have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln
Stained glass, as an art and a craft, requires the artistic skill to conceive an appropriate and workable design, and the engineering skills to assemble the piece In this context, the purpose of a stained glass window is not to allow those within a building to see the world outside or even primarily to admit light but rather to control it For this reason stained glass windows have been described as "illuminated wall decorations"
Stained glass is still popular today, but often referred to as art glass Artists and companies are contracted to create beautiful art glass ranging from domes, windows, backsplashes, etc
During the late medieval period, glass factories were set up where there was a ready supply of silica, the essential material for glass manufacture Silica requires a very high temperature to melt, something not all glass factories were able to achieve Other substances, such as lime, are added to rebuild the weakened network and make the glass more stable Copper oxides produce green or bluish green, cobalt makes deep blue, and gold produces wine red and violet glass Much modern red glass is produced using copper, which is less expensive than gold and gives a brighter, more vermilion shade of red Glass coloured while in the clay pot in the furnace is known as pot metal glass, as opposed to flashed glass
Cylinder glass or Muff
Using a blow-pipe, a "gather" (glob) of molten glass is taken from the pot heating in the furnace "Hand-blown" cylinder (also called muff glass) and crown glass were the types used in ancient stained-glass windows Stained glass windows were normally in churches and chapels as well as many more well respected buildings
Crown glass
This hand-blown glass is created by blowing a bubble of air into a gather of molten glass and then spinning it, either by hand or on a table that revolves rapidly like a potter's wheel Glass formed this way can be either coloured and used for stained-glass windows, or uncoloured as seen in small paned windows in 16th- and 17th-century houses The center of each piece of glass, known as the "bull's-eye", is subject to less acceleration during spinning, so it remains thicker than the rest of the sheet It also has the distinctive lump of glass left by the "pontil" rod, which holds the glass as it is spun out Crown glass is still made today, but not on a large scale
Rolled glass
Rolled glass (sometimes called "table glass") is produced by pouring molten glass onto a metal or graphite table and immediately rolling it into a sheet using a large metal cylinder, similar to rolling out a pie crust Glass can be "double rolled", which means it is passed through two cylinders at once (similar to the clothes wringers on older washing machines) to yield glass of a specified thickness (typically about 1/8" or 3mm) The glass is then annealed Rolled glass was first commercially produced around the mid-1830s and is widely used today It is often called cathedral glass, but this has nothing to do with medieval cathedrals, where the glass used was hand-blown
Flashed glass
Architectural glass must be at least of an inch (3Â mm) thick to survive the push and pull of typical wind loads However, in the creation of red glass, the colouring ingredients must be of a certain concentration, or the colour will not develop This results in a colour so intense that at the thickness of inch (3Â mm), the red glass transmits little light and appears black The method employed is to laminate a thin layer of red glass to a thicker body of glass that is clear or lightly tinted, forming "flashed glass"
A lightly coloured molten gather is dipped into a pot of molten red glass, which is then blown into a sheet of laminated glass using either the cylinder (muff) or the crown technique described above Once this method was found for making red glass, other colours were made this way as well A great advantage is that the double-layered glass can be engraved or abraded to reveal the clear or tinted glass below A number of artists have embraced the possibilities flashed glass gives them In the medieval period the glass was abraded; later, hydrofluoric acid was used to remove the flash in a chemical reaction (a very dangerous technique), and in the 19th century sandblasting started to be used for this purpose
Modern production of traditional glass
There are a number of glass factories, notably in Germany, the United States, England, France, Poland and Russia, which produce high-quality glass, both hand-blown (cylinder, muff, crown) and rolled (cathedral and opalescent) Modern stained-glass artists have a number of resources to use and the work of centuries of other artists from which to learn as they continue the tradition in new ways In the late 19th and 20th centuries there have been many innovations in techniques and in the types of glass used Many new types of glass have been developed for use in stained glass windows, in particular Tiffany glass and Dalle de verre
Transparent glass
Ordinary soda-lime glass appears colourless to the naked eye when it is thin, although iron oxide impurities produce a green tint which becomes evident in thick pieces or can be seen with the aid of scientific instruments A number of additives are used to reduce the green tint, particularly if the glass is to be used for plain window glass, rather than stained glass windows Additives that reduce the green tint include manganese dioxide which produces sodium permanganate, and may result in a slightly mauve tint, characteristic of the glass in older houses in New England
Green glass
While very pale green is the typical colour of transparent glass, deeper greens can be achieved by the addition of Iron(II) oxide which results in a bluish-green glass Together with chromium it gives glass of a richer green colour, typical of the glass used to make wine bottles
The addition of chromium yields dark green glass, suitable for flashed glass Together with tin oxide and arsenic it yields emerald green glass
Creating stained glass windows
The first stage in the production of a window is to make, or acquire from the architect or owners of the building, an accurate template of the window opening that the glass is to fit The designer must take into account the design, the structure of the window, the nature and size of the glass available and his or her own preferred technique The cartoon is then divided into a patchwork, providing a template for each small glass piece The exact position of the lead which holds the glass in place is also noted, as it is part of the calculated visual effect
Selecting and painting the glass
Each piece of glass is selected for the desired colour and cut to match a section of the templateDetails of faces, hair and hands can be painted onto the inner surface of the glass using a special glass paint which contains finely ground lead or copper filings, ground glass, gum arabic and a medium such as wine, vinegar or (traditionally) urine It was usually painted onto the outside of a piece of glass, then fired to make it permanent This yellow was particularly useful for enhancing borders, canopies and haloes, and turning blue glass into green glass
In the 16th century, a range of glass stains were introduced, most of them coloured by ground glass particles Painting on glass with these stains was initially used for small heraldic designs and other details By the 17th century a style of stained glass had evolved that was no longer dependent upon the skilful cutting of coloured glass into sections Scenes were painted onto glass panels of square format, like tiles The colours were then annealed to the glass before the pieces were assembled
A method used for embellishment and gilding is the decoration of one side of each of two pieces of thin glass, which are then placed back to back within the lead came
Once the glass is cut and painted, the pieces are assembled by slotting them into H-sectioned lead cames All the joints are then soldered together and the glass pieces are prevented from rattling and the window made weatherproof by forcing a soft oily cement or mastic between the glass and the cames For further technical details, see Came glasswork
Stained glass has been produced since ancient times Both the Egyptians and the Romans excelled at the manufacture of small colored glass objects Phoenicia was important in glass manufacture with its chief centres Sidon, Tyre and Antioch
In early Christian churches of the 4th and 5th centuries, there are many remaining windows which are filled with ornate patterns of thinly-sliced alabaster set into wooden frames, giving a stained-glass like effect
Evidence of stained-glass windows in churches and monasteries in Britain can be found as early as the 7th century Hundreds of pieces of coloured glass and lead, dating back to the late 7th century, have been discovered here and at Jarrow
In the Middle East, the glass industry of Syria continued during the Islamic period with major centres of manufacture at Raqqa, Aleppo and Damascus and the most important products being highly transparent colourless glass and gilded glass, rather than coloured glass
The creation of stained glass in Southwest Asia began in ancient times One of the region's earliest surviving formulations for the production of colored glass comes from the Assyrian city of Nineveh, dating to the seventh century BC The "Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna", attributed to the 8th century alchemist JÄbir ibn HayyÄn, discusses the production of colored glass in ancient Babylon and Egypt The "Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna" also describes how to create colored glass and artificial gemstones made from high-quality stained glass The tradition of stained glass manufacture has continued, with mosques, palaces, and public spaces being decorated with stained glass throughout the Islamic world The stained glass of Islam is generally non-pictorial and of purely geometric design, but may contain both floral motifs and text 
Medieval glass in Europe
Stained glass, as an art form, reached its height in the Middle Ages when it became a major pictorial form used to illustrate the narratives of the Bible to a largely illiterate populace
In the Romanesque and Early Gothic period, from about 950 to 1240, the untraceried windows demanded large expanses of glass which of necessity were supported by robust iron frames, such as may be seen at Chartres Cathedral and at the eastern end of Canterbury Cathedral
Integrated with the lofty verticals of Gothic cathedrals and parish churches, glass designs became more daring
While stained glass was widely manufactured, Chartres was the greatest centre of stained glass manufacture, producing glass of unrivalled quality
Probably the earliest scheme of stained glass windows that was created during the Renaissance was that for Florence Cathedral, devised by Lorenzo Ghiberti
In Europe, stained glass continued to be produced; the style evolved from the Gothic to the Classical, which is well represented in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, despite the rise of Protestantism In France, much glass of this period was produced at the Limoges factory, and in Italy at Murano, where stained glass and faceted lead crystal are often coupled together in the same window
At the Reformation in England, large numbers of medieval and Renaissance windows were smashed and replaced with plain glass With the latter wave of destruction the traditional methods of working with stained glass died, and were not rediscovered in England until the early 19th century See Stained glass â British glass, 1811â1918 for more details
In the Netherlands a rare scheme of glass has remained intact at Grote Sint-Jan Church, Gouda This brought about a great demand for the revival of the art of stained glass window making
Among the earliest 19th-century English manufacturers and designers were William Warrington and John Hardman of Birmingham, whose nephew, John Hardman Powell, had a commercial eye and exhibited works at the Philadelphia Exhibition of 1876, influencing stained glass in the United States of America
In France there was a greater continuity of stained glass production than in England In the early 19th century most stained glass was made of large panes that were extensively painted and fired, the designs often being copied directly from oil paintings by famous artists In 1824 the SÃ¨vres porcelain factory began producing stained glass to supply the increasing demand From 1839 onwards much stained glass was produced that very closely imitated medieval glass, both in the artwork and in the nature of the glass itself
Other glass was designed in a more Classical manner, and characterised by the brilliant cerulean colour of the blue backgrounds (as against the purple-blue of the glass of Chartres) and the use of pink and mauve glass There was a great demand for stained glass Much 19th-century German glass has large sections of painted detail rather than outlines and details dependent on the lead A major firm was Mayer of Munich, which commenced glass production in 1860, and is still operating as "Franz Mayer of Munich, Inc German stained glass found a market across Europe, in America and Australia Stained glass studios were also founded in Italy and Belgium at this time
In the Austrian Empire and later Austria-Hungary, one of the leading stained glass artists was Carl Geyling, who founded his studio in 1841 Carl Geyling's Erben completed numerous stained glass windows for major churches in Vienna and elsewhere, and received an Imperial and Royal Warrant of Appointment from emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria
Among the most innovative English designers were the Pre-Raphaelites, William Morris (1834â1898) and Edward Burne-Jones (1833â1898), whose work heralds the influential Arts & Crafts Movement, which regenerated stained glass throughout the English-speaking world In Ireland, a generation of young artists taught by Whall's pupil Alfred Child at Dublin's Metropolitan School of Art created a distinctive national school of stained glass: its leading representatives were Wilhelmina Geddes, Michael Healy and Harry Clarke
Art Nouveau or Belle Epoch stained glass design flourished in France, and Eastern Europe, where it can be identified by the use of curving, sinuous lines in the lead, and swirling motifs
J&R Lamb Studios, established in 1857 in New York City, was the first major decorative arts studio in the United States and for many years a major producer of ecclesiastical stained glass
Notable American practitioners include John La Farge (1835â1910), who invented opalescent glass and for which he received a U However, a reaction against the aesthetics and technique of opalescent windows - led initially by architects such as Ralph Adams Cram - led to a rediscovery of traditional stained glass in the early 1900s Connick (1875-1945), who founded his Boston studio in 1913, was profoundly influenced by his study of medieval stained glass in Europe and by the Arts & Crafts philosophy of Englishman Christopher Whall At the same time there were also some interesting developments where stained glass artists took studios in shared facilities
Other artists sought to transform an ancient art form into a contemporary one, sometimes using traditional techniques while exploiting the medium of glass in innovative ways and in combination with different materials The use of slab glass, a technique known as Dalle de Verre, where the glass is set in concrete or epoxy resin, was a 20th-century innovation credited to Jean Gaudin and brought to the UK by Pierre Fourmaintraux One of the most prolific glass artists using this technique was the Dominican Friar Dom Charles Norris OSB of Buckfast Abbey
Gemmail, a technique developed by the French artist Jean Crotti in 1936 and perfected in the 1950s, is a type of stained glass where adjacent pieces of glass are overlapped without using lead cames to join the pieces, allowing for greater diversity and subtlety of colour
Among the early well-known 20th-century artists who experimented with stained glass as an Abstract art form were Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian In the 1960s and 1970s the Expressionist painter Marc Chagall produced designs for many stained glass windows that are intensely coloured and crammed with symbolic details Important 20th-century stained glass artists include John Hayward, Douglas Strachan, Ervin Bossanyi, Louis Davis, Wilhelmina Geddes, Karl Parsons, John Piper, Patrick Reyntiens, Johannes Schreiter, Judith Schaechter, Paul Woodroffe, Jean RenÃ© Bazaine at Saint SÃ©verin, Sergio de Castro at Couvrechef- La Folie (Caen), Hamburg-Dulsberg and Romont (Switzerland), and the Loire Studio of Gabriel Loire at Chartres
In Germany, stained glass development continued with the inter-war work of Johan Thorn Prikker and Josef Albers, and the postwar achievements of Joachim Klos, Johannes Schreiter and Ludwig Shaffrath Trends included the abandonment of figurative designs and of painting on glass in favour of a mix of biomorphic and rigorously geometric abstraction and the calligraphic non-functional use of leads The works of Ludwig Schaffrath demonstrate the late 20th-century trends in the use of stained glass for architectural purposes, filling entire walls with coloured and textured glass In the 1970s young British stained-glass artists such as Brian Clarke were influenced by the large scale and abstraction in German twentieth-century glass
In the UK, the professional organisation for stained glass artists has been the British Society of Master Glass Painters, founded in 1921 It continues to be Britain's only organisation devoted exclusively to the art and craft of stained glass From the outset, its chief objectives have been to promote and encourage high standards in stained glass painting and staining, to act as a locus for the exchange of information and ideas within the stained glass craft and to preserve the invaluable stained glass heritage of Britainuk for a range of stained glass lectures, conferences, tours, portfolios of recent stained glass commissions by members, and information on courses and the conservation of stained glass Back issues of The Journal of Stained Glass are listed and there is a searchable index for stained glass articles, an invaluable resource for stained glass researchers
After the First World War, stained glass window memorials were a popular choice among wealthier families, examples can be found in churches across the UK One of these is Florida State University's Master Craftsman Program, which recently completed a high stained-glass windows, designed by Robert Bischoff, the programâs director, and Jo Ann, his wife and installed to overlook Bobby Bowden Field at Doak Campbell Stadium
Buildings incorporating stained glass windows
Stained glass windows were commonly used in churches for decorative and informative purposes For more information on the use of stained glass to depict religious subjects, see Poor Man's Bible
In addition to Christian churches, stained glass windows have been incorporated into Jewish temple architecture for centuries From the mid-20th century to the present, stained glass windows have been a ubiquitous feature of American synagogue architecture Styles and themes for synagogue stained glass artwork are as diverse as their church counterparts As with churches, synagogue stained glass windows are often dedicated by member families in exchange for major financial contributions to the institution
Mausolea, whether for general community use or for private family use, may employ stained glass as a comforting entry for natural light, for memorialization, or for display of religious imagery
Stained glass windows in houses were particularly popular in the Victorian era and many domestic examples survive In their simplest form they typically depict birds and flowers in small panels, often surrounded with machine-made "cathedral glass" which, despite what the name suggests, is pale-coloured and textured Some large homes have splendid examples of secular pictorial glass
Stained glass has often been used as a decorative element in public buildings, initially in places of learning, government or justice but increasingly in other public and commercial places such as banks, retailers and railway stations Public houses in some countries make extensive use of stained glass and leaded lights to create a comfortable atmosphere and retain privacy Grease pencils have a softer, crayon-like waxy core that can leave marks on smooth surfaces such as glass or porcelain The pH of aqueous solutions can be measured with a glass electrode and a pH meter, or a color-changing indicator
To apply this process in practice, a glass electrode is used rather than the cumbersome hydrogen electrode A combined glass electrode has an in-built reference electrode
The glass electrode (and other ion selective electrodes) should be calibrated in a medium similar to the one being investigated0003Â mol dmâ3 alkaline) requires special procedures because, when using the glass electrode, the Nernst law breaks down under those conditions At high pH the glass electrode may be affected by "alkaline error", because the electrode becomes sensitive to the concentration of cations such as Na+ and K+ in the solution Some good quality books of pastel papers also include glassine to separate pages
A chart that gave the inequality a very visible and comprehensible form, the so-called "champagne glass" effect, was contained in the 1992 United Nations Development Program Report, which showed that distribution of global income is very uneven, with the richest 20% of the world's population controlling 82
The "snug" was a small private room or area which typically had access to the bar and a frosted glass window, set above head height Founded by German merchant Georg Wertheim (1857â1939), designed by architect Alfred Messel (1853â1909), opened in 1897 and extended several times over the following 40 years, it ultimately possessed a floor area double that of the Reichstag, a 330-metre-long granite and plate glass facade along Leipziger StraÃe, 83 elevators, three escalators, 1,000 telephones, 10,000 lamps, five kilometres of pneumatic tubing for moving items from the various departments to the packing area, and a separate entrance directly from the nearby U-Bahn station One design submitted by Wagner himself comprised an array of gleaming new buildings arranged around a vast multi-level system of fly-overs and underpasses, with a huge glass-roofed circular car-park in the middle This new Sony Centre, designed by Helmut Jahn, is an eye-catching monolith of glass and steel featuring an enormous tent-like conical roof, its shape reportedly inspired by Mount Fuji in Japan, covering an elliptical central public space up to 102 metres across, and thus differing substantially from Hilmer & Sattler's original plan for the sitedi ("Vereinte Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft", meaning United Services Union), rises to 45 metres and has a curving glass facade designed to evoke the shape of that erstwhile landmark Resistive and capacitive touchscreens have conductive materials embedded in the glass and detect the position of the touch by measuring changes in electric currentNesovitrea

The history of glass-making dates back to at least 3600 years ago in Mesopotamia However, some claim they may have been producing copies of glass objects from Egypt Other archaeological evidence suggests that the first true glass was made in coastal north Syria, Mesopotamia or Egypt The earliest known glass objects, of the mid second millennium BC, were beads, perhaps initially created as the accidental by-products of metal-working (slags) or during the production of faience, a pre-glass vitreous material made by a process similar to glazing Glass products remained a luxury until the disasters that overtook the late Bronze Age civilizations seemingly brought glass-making to a halt
Development of glass technology in India may have begun in 1730 BC In ancient China, though, glass-making seems to have had a late start compared to ceramics and metal work From across the former Roman Empire archaeologists have recovered glass objects that were used in domestic, industrial and funerary contexts
Anglo-Saxon glass has been found across England during archaeological excavations of both settlement and cemetery sites
Naturally occurring glass, especially the volcanic glass obsidian, has been used by many Stone Age societies across the globe for the production of sharp cutting tools and, due to its limited source areas, was extensively traded But in general, archaeological evidence suggests that the first true glass was made in coastal north Syria, Mesopotamia or ancient Egypt Because of Egypt's favorable environment for preservation, the majority of well-studied early glass is found there, although some of this is likely to have been imported The earliest known glass objects, of the mid-third millennium BC, were beads, perhaps initially created as accidental by-products of metal-working (slags) or during the production of faience, a pre-glass vitreous material made by a process similar to glazing, Megiddo), there was a rapid growth in glassmaking technology Archaeological finds from this period include colored glass ingots, vessels (often colored and shaped in imitation of highly prized hardstone carvings in semi-precious stones) and the ubiquitous beads The alkali of Syrian and Egyptian glass was soda ash (sodium carbonate), which can be extracted from the ashes of many plants, notably halophile seashore plants like saltwort The latest vessels were 'core-formed', produced by winding a ductile rope of glass around a shaped core of sand and clay over a metal rod, then fusing it with repeated reheatings
Threads of thin glass of different colors made with admixtures of oxides were subsequently wound around these to create patterns, which could be drawn into festoons by using metal raking tools The rod was subsequently allowed to cool as the glass slowly annealed and was eventually removed from the center of the vessel, after which the core material was scraped out Much early glass production, however, relied on grinding techniques borrowed from stone working This meant that the glass was ground and carved in a cold state
By the 15th century BC, extensive glass production was occurring in Western Asia, Crete, and Egypt; and the Mycenaean Greek term , "ku-wa-no-wo-ko-i", meaning "workers of lapis lazuli and glass" (written in Linear b syllabic script) is attested 
It is thought that the techniques and recipes required for the initial fusing of glass from raw materials was a closely guarded technological secret reserved for the large palace industries of powerful states Glass workers in other areas therefore relied on imports of preformed glass, often in the form of cast ingots such as those found on the Ulu Burun shipwreck off the coast of modern Turkey
Glass remained a luxury material, and the disasters that overtook Late Bronze Age civilizations seem to have brought glass-making to a halt It picked up again in its former sites, Syria and Cyprus, in the 9th century BC, when the techniques for making colorless glass were discovered The first glassmaking "manual" dates back to ca Instructions on how to make glass are contained in cuneiform tablets discovered in the library of the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal In Egypt glass-making did not revive until it was reintroduced in Ptolemaic Alexandria During the Hellenistic period many new techniques of glass production were introduced and glass began to be used to make larger pieces, notably table wares Techniques developed during this period include 'slumping' viscous (but not fully molten) glass over a mould in order to form a dish and 'millefiori' (meaning 'thousand flowers') technique, where canes of multicolored glass were sliced and the slices arranged together and fused in a mould to create a mosaic-like effect It was also during this period that colorless or decolored glass began to be prized and methods for achieving this effect were investigated more fully
According to Pliny the Elder, Phoenician traders were the first to stumble upon glass manufacturing techniques at the site of the Belus River Georgius Agricola, in "De re metallica", reported a traditional serendipitous "discovery" tale of familiar type:
"The tradition is that a merchant ship laden with nitrum being moored at this place, the merchants were preparing their meal on the beach, and not having stones to prop up their pots, they used lumps of nitrum from the ship, which fused and mixed with the sands of the shore, and there flowed streams of a new translucent liquid, and thus was the origin of glass"
This account is more a reflection of Roman experience of glass production, however, as white silica sand from this area was used in the production of glass within the Roman Empire due to its high purity levels During the 1st century BC glass blowing was discovered on the Syro-Judean coast, revolutionizing the industry A growth of the use of glass products occurred throughout the Roman world Glass became the Roman plastic, and glass containers produced in Alexandria spread throughout the Roman Empire With the discovery of clear glass (through the introduction of manganese dioxide), by glass blowers in Alexandria circa 100 AD, the Romans began to use glass for architectural purposes Cast glass windows, albeit with poor optical qualities, began to appear in the most important buildings in Rome and the most luxurious villas of Herculaneum and Pompeii Over the next 1,000 years, glass making and working continued and spread through southern Europe and beyond
The first Persian glass was discovered in the explorations of Dinkhahtepe in Azarbaijan by Burny It was glass bead from the late Bronze Age (1600 B Many glass tubes were discovered by French teams Today it is certain that the mosaic glass cups from the Iron Age of North Iran, such as Hassnlou Tepe, Marlik Tepe It resembles a number of Mesopotamian examples, in Susa of late Elam, a few glass vessels were discovered, of core forming technique In this time Achamind bowls and colorless glass growing on empair but in Selukid and Parthian times Helleni and Roman techniques were prevalented and Sassanian era seem local motives on glass vessels
Indian development of glass technology in South Asia may have begun in 1730 BC Evidence of this culture includes a red-brown glass bead along with a hoard of beads dating to that period, making it the earliest attested glass from the Indus Valley locations
Chalcolithic evidence of glass has been found in Hastinapur, India 
Some of the texts which mention glass in India are the "Shatapatha Brahmana" and "Vinaya Pitaka"
By the 1st century AD, glass was being used for ornaments and casing in South Asia Contact with the Greco-Roman world added newer techniques, and Indians artisans mastered several techniques of glass molding, decorating and coloring by the succeeding centuries The Satavahana period of India also produced short cylinders of composite glass, including those displaying a lemon yellow matrix covered with green glass
In Chinese history, glass played a peripheral role in the arts and crafts, when compared to ceramics and metal work The limited archaeological distribution and use of glass objects are evidence of the rarity of the material Literary sources date the first manufacture of glass to the 5th century AD However, the earliest archaeological evidence for glass manufacture in China comes from the Warring States period (475 BC to 221 BC)
Chinese learned to manufacture glass comparably later than the Mesopotamians, Egyptians and Indians Imported glass objects first reached China during the late Spring and Autumn period â early Warring States period (early 5th century BC), in the form of polychrome âeye beadsâ These imports created the impetus for the production of indigenous glass beads
During the Han period (206 BC to 220 AD) the use of glass diversified The introduction of glass casting in this period encouraged the production of moulded objects, such as bi disks and other ritual objects The Chinese glass objects from the Warring States period and Han Dynasty vary greatly in chemical composition from the imported glass objects The glasses from this period contain high levels of barium oxide (BaO) and lead, distinguishing them from the soda-lime-silica glasses of Western Asia and Mesopotamia At the end of the Han Dynasty (AD 220), the lead-barium glass tradition declined, with glass production only resuming during the 4th and 5th centuries AD
Roman glass production developed from Hellenistic technical traditions, initially concentrating on the production of intensely colored cast glass vessels Glass was used primarily for the production of vessels, although mosaic tiles and window glass were also produced
However, during the 1st century AD, the industry underwent rapid technical growth that saw the introduction of glass blowing and the dominance of colorless or âaquaâ glasses Production of raw glass was undertaken in geographically separate locations to the working of glass into finished vessels, and by the end of the 1st century AD large scale manufacturing, primarily in Alexandria, resulted in the establishment of glass as a commonly available material in the Roman world
Islamic glass continued the achievements of pre-Islamic cultures, especially the Sasanian glass of Persia The Arab poet al-Buhturi (820â897) described the clarity of such glass: "Its color hides the glass as if it is standing in it without a container" In the 8th century, the Persian-Arab chemist JÄbir ibn HayyÄn (Geber) described 46 recipes for producing colored glass in "Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna" ("The Book of the Hidden Pearl"), in addition to 12 recipes inserted by al-Marrakishi in a later edition of the book By the 11th century, clear glass mirrors were being produced in Arab Islamic Spain
The Roman tradition of very fine glassmaking did not continue in the Middle Ages, and Anglo-Saxon glass and other regional traditions were mainly functional pieces, mostly somewhat crude forest glass The claw beaker was popular as a relatively easy to make but impressive vessel that exploited the unique potential of glass Only at the end of the period did European glass vessels once again become very fine in quality, imitating those imported from the Islamic world Around 1000Â AD, an important technical breakthrough was made in Northern Europe when soda glass, produced from white pebbles and burnt vegetation was replaced by glass made from a much more readily available material: potash obtained from wood ashes From this point on, northern glass differed significantly from that made in the Mediterranean area, where soda remained in common use
Until the 12th century, stained glass â glass to which metallic or other impurities had been added for coloring â was not widely used, but it rapidly became an important medium for Romanesque art and especially Gothic art The 11th century saw the emergence in Germany of new ways of making sheet glass by blowing spheres The crown glass process was used up to the mid-19th century In this process, the glassblower would spin approximately 9 pounds (4Â kg) of molten glass at the end of a rod until it flattened into a disk approximately 5 feet (1 Domestic glass vessels in late medieval Northern Europe are known as forest glass
Anglo-Saxon glass has been found across England during archaeological excavations of both settlement and cemetery sites In the 5th century AD with the Roman departure from Britain, there were also considerable changes in the usage of glass Excavation of Romano-British sites have revealed plentiful amounts of glass but, in contrast, the amount recovered from 5th century and later Anglo-Saxon sites is minuscule
The majority of complete vessels and assemblages of beads come from the excavations of early Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, but a change in burial rites in the late 7th century affected the recovery of glass, as Christian Anglo-Saxons were buried with fewer grave goods, and glass is rarely found From the late 7th century onwards, window glass is found more frequently There are a few Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastical literary sources that mention the production and use of glass, although these relate to window glass used in ecclesiastical buildings Glass was also used by the Anglo-Saxons in their jewelry, both as enamel or as cut glass insets
The center for luxury Italian glassmaking from the 14th century was the island of Murano, which developed many new techniques and became the center of a lucrative export trade in dinnerware, mirrors, and other items What made Venetian Murano glass significantly different was that the local quartz pebbles were almost pure silica, and were ground into a fine clear sand that was combined with soda ash obtained from the Levant, for which the Venetians held the sole monopoly The clearest and finest glass is tinted in two ways: firstly, a natural coloring agent is ground and melted with the glass Black glass was called "obsidianus" after obsidian stone A second method is apparently to produce a black glass which, when held to the light, will show the true color that this glass will give to another glass when used as a dye
The Venetian ability to produce this superior form of glass resulted in a trade advantage over other glass producing lands Muranoâs reputation as a center for glassmaking was born when the Venetian Republic, fearing fire might burn down the cityâs mostly wood buildings, ordered glassmakers to move their foundries to Murano in 1291 Murano's glassmakers were soon the islandâs most prominent citizens Many took a risk and set up glass furnaces in surrounding cities and as far afield as England and the Netherlands
Bohemian glass, or Bohemia crystal, is a decorative glass produced in regions of Bohemia and Silesia, now in the current state of the Czech Republic, since the 13th century Oldest archaeology excavations of glass-making sites date to around 1250 and are located in the Lusatian Mountains of Northern Bohemia Most notable sites of glass-making throughout the ages are Skalice (), KamenickÃ½ Å enov () and NovÃ½ Bor () It was especially outstanding in its manufacture of glass in high Baroque style from 1685 to 1750 In the 17th century, Caspar Lehmann, gem cutter to Emperor Rudolf II in Prague, adapted to glass the technique of gem engraving with copper and bronze wheels
Modern glass production
A very important advance in glass manufacture was the technique of adding lead oxide to the molten glass; this improved the appearance of the glass and made it easier to melt using sea-coal as a furnace fuel This technique also increased the "working period" of the glass, making it easier to manipulate The process was first discovered by George Ravenscroft in 1674, who was the first to produce clear lead crystal glassware on an industrial scale Ravenscroft had the cultural and financial resources necessary to revolutionise the glass trade, allowing England to overtake Venice as the centre of the glass industry in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries Seeking to find an alternative to Venetian "cristallo", he used flint as a silica source, but his glasses tended to crizzle, developing a network of small cracks destroying its transparency
He was granted a protective patent in 1673, where production and refinement moved from his glasshouse on the Savoy to the seclusion of Henley-on-Thames
By 1696, after the patent expired, twenty-seven glasshouses in England were producing flint glass and were exporting all over Europe with such success that, in 1746, the British Government imposed a lucrative tax on it Rather than drastically reduce the lead content of their glass, manufacturers responded by creating highly decorated, smaller, more delicate forms, often with hollow stems, known to collectors today as "Excise glasses" The British glass making industry was able to take off with the repeal of the tax in 1845
Evidence of the use of the blown plate glass method dates back to 1620 in London and was used for mirrors and coach plates Thevart perfected the process of casting Polished plate glass in 1688 in France Prior to this invention, mirror plates, made from blown "sheet" glass, had been limited in size De Nehou's process of rolling molten glass poured on an iron table rendered the manufacture of very large plates possible The polishing process was industrialized around 1800 with the adoption of a steam engine to carry out the grinding and polishing of the cast glass
The use of glass as a building material was heralded by The Crystal Palace of 1851, built by Joseph Paxton to house the Great Exhibition Paxton's revolutionary new building inspired the public use of glass as a material for domestic and horticultural architecture In 1832, the British Crown Glass Company (later Chance Brothers) became the first company to adopt the cylinder method to produce sheet glass with the expertise of Georges Bontemps, a famous French glassmaker This glass was produced by blowing long cylinders of glass, which were then cut along the length and then flattened onto a cast-iron table, before being annealed Plate glass involves the glass being ladled onto a cast-iron bed, where it is rolled into a sheet with an iron roller This allowed a ribbed finish and was often used for extensive glass roofs such as within railway stations
An early advance in automating glass manufacturing was patented in 1848 by the engineer Henry Bessemer His system produced a continuous ribbon of flat glass by forming the ribbon between rollers This was an expensive process, as the surfaces of the glass needed polishing and was later abandoned by its sponsor, Robert Lucas Chance of Chance Brothers, as unviable Bessemer also introduced an early form of "Float Glass" in 1843, which involved pouring glass onto liquid tin
In 1887, the mass production of glass was developed by the firm Ashley in Castleford, Yorkshire Chance Brothers also introduced the machine rolled patterned glass method in 1888
In 1898, Pilkington invented Wired Cast glass, where the glass incorporates a strong steel-wire mesh for safety and security The Machine Drawn Cylinder technique was invented in the US and was the first mechanical method for the drawing of window glass Between 1953 and 1957, Sir Alastair Pilkington and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UK's Pilkington Brothers developed the revolutionary float glass process, the first successful commercial application for forming a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten tin bath on which the molten glass flows unhindered under the influence of gravity Modern windows are made from float glass Most float glass is soda-lime glass, but relatively minor quantities of specialty borosilicate and flat panel display glass are also produced using the float glass process The success of this process lay in the careful balance of the volume of glass fed onto the bath, where it was flattened by its own weight Full scale profitable sales of float glass were first achieved in 1960 To Cinderella's amazement, the shoes have been transformed into dancing slippers of glass Only the glass slippers will remain as a gift for her kindness Though the Prince pursues her, she vanishes into the night moments before the spell breaks, losing one of her glass slippers in her haste and panic As she relives some of the dances of the ball, she discovers the remaining glass slipper and realizes that it was all true Their fighting is interrupted when the father and step-mother hurry in with the news that the Prince is on his way to their house, desperately trying a glass slipper on every girl he encounters As Cinderella successfully tries on both glass slippers, her step-family beg for her forgiveness, which she happily bestows upon them
After enjoying what he thinks is a glass of water, Ransom realizes that he has been drugged The design uses 192 beamlines in a parallel system of flashlamp-pumped, neodymium-doped phosphate glass lasers The light then passes four times through a circuit containing a neodymium glass amplifier similar to (but much smaller than) the ones used in the main beamlines, boosting the nanojoules of light created in the Master Oscillator to about 6Â joules
The main amplification takes place in a series of glass amplifiers located at one end of the beamlines Previous devices generally had to cool down for many hours to allow the flashlamps and laser glass to regain their shapes after firing (due to thermal expansion), limiting use to one or fewer firings a day LLNL decided early on to concentrate on glass lasers, while other facilities studied gas lasers using carbon dioxide (e
A variety of research and development, technology and engineering challenges also had to be overcome, such as working with the optics industry to create a precision large optics fabrication capability to supply the laser glass for NIF's 7,500 meter-sized optics Continuous-pour glass, rapid-growth crystals, innovative optical switches, and deformable mirrors were among the technology innovations developed for NIF This was solved by re-designing the hohlraum with two layers of glass on either end, in effect creating a storm window They create a distinctive hourglass shape, making the water channel narrow in the middle and wider at each end This hourglass shape could be the result of a natural selection process toward optimal permeabilityStudio glass

Studio glass is the modern use of glass as an artistic medium to produce sculptures or three-dimensional artworks The glass objects created are intended to make a sculptural or decorative statement
During the early 20th-century (before the early 1960s), contemporary glass art was generally made by teams of factory workers, taking glass from furnaces containing a thousand or more pounds This form of glass art, of which Tiffany and Steuben in the U, GallÃ© in France and Hoya Crystal in Japan, Royal Leerdam Crystal in the Netherlands and Orrefors and Kosta Boda in Sweden are perhaps the best known, grew out of the factory system in which all glass objects were hand or mold blown by teams
Modern glass studios use a great variety of techniques in creating glass artworks, including:
History
From the 19th century, various types of fancy glass started to become significant branches of the decorative arts Cameo glass was revived for the first time since the Romans, initially mostly used for pieces in a neo-classical style The Art Nouveau movement in particular made great use of glass, with RenÃ© Lalique, Ãmile GallÃ©, and Daum of Nancy important names in the first French wave of the movement, producing colored vases and similar pieces, often in cameo glass, and also using lustre techniques Louis Comfort Tiffany in America specialized in secular stained glass, mostly of plant subjects, both in panels and his famous lamps From the 20th century, some glass artists began to class themselves as sculptors working in glass and as part of the fine arts
In the early 20th century, most glass production happened in factories Even individual glassblowers making their own personalized designs would do their work in those large shared buildings The idea of "art glass" grew â small decorative works in small production runs, often with designs or objects inside
By the 1970s, there were good designs for smaller furnaces, and in the United States this gave rise to the "studio glass" movement of glassblowers, who worked outside of factories, often in their own buildings or studios
Modern glass studios use a great variety of techniques in creating their pieces The ancient technique of blown glass, where a glassblower works at a furnace full of molten glass using metal rods and hand tools to blow and shape almost any form of glass, is one of the more popular ways to work
Another type is flame-worked glass, which uses torches and kilns in its production The artist generally works at a bench using rods and tubes of glass, shaping with hand tools to create their work In the 21st century, flame-worked glass became commonly used as adornments on functional items The glass conductor's baton, commissioned by Chandler Bridges for Dr
Cast glass can be done at the furnace, at the torch or in a kiln Generally the artist makes a mold out of refractory, sand, or plaster and silica which can be filled with either clear glass or colored or patterned glass, depending on the techniques and effects desired Slumped glass and fused glass is similar to cast glass, but it is not done at as high of a temperature Usually the glass is only heated enough to impress a shape or a texture onto the piece, or to stick several pieces of glass together without a glue
The traditional technique of stained glass is still employed for the creation of studio glass The artist cuts the glass into shapes and sets the pieces into lead cames which are soldered together They artist can also use hot techniques in a kiln to create texture, patterns, or change the overall shape of the glass
Etched glass is created by dipping glass that has an acid resistant pattern applied to its surface into an acid solution
Cold glass is any glass worked without the use of heat
The studio glass movement
The international studio glass movement originated in America, spreading to Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia and Asia Indeed, glass was part of the curriculum at art schools such as the Bauhaus Frank Lloyd Wright's produced glass windows considered by some as masterpieces not only of design, but of painterly composition as well began to gain in popularity and importance, and American artists interested in glass looked for new paths outside industry Harvey Littleton, often referred to as the "Father of the Studio Glass Movement", was inspired to develop studio glassblowing in America by the great glass being designed and made in Italy, Sweden and many other places, and by the pioneering work in ceramics of the California potter Peter Voulkos Harvey Littleton and Dominick Labino held the now-famous glass workshop at the Toledo Museum of Art in 1962 The goal was to melt glass in a small furnace so individual artists could use glass as an art medium in a non-industrial setting This was the workshop that would stimulate the studio glass movement that spread around the world Instead of the large, industrial settings of the past, a glass artist could now work with a small glass furnace in an individual setting and produce art from glass
Modern regional glass art
The early glass movement (studio glass) in Australia was spurred on by a visit to Australia by American artist Bill Boysen, who toured the country in the early seventies with a mobile studio Boysen traveled to Australia in 1974, where he promoted glass artistry by presenting a "revolutionary demonstration of glass blowing" to a gathering of around 250 attendees Boysen's mobile studio "successfully toured eight eastern statesâ venues in â74, thus greatly enhancing the credibility of hand crafted glass" Boysen's visit is credited with helping "inspire a generation of [Australian] artists to work with glass and eventually led to the creation of the national glass art collection" in Wagga Wagga, Australia This important collection includes over 450 works of art and is "the most comprehensive public collection of Australian studio glass anywhere" Since that time Australian glass has gained worldwide recognition with Adelaide in South Australia, hosting the International Glass Art Society Conference in 2005 on only its third occasion outside of the U The Ranamok Glass Prize, presented every year from 1994 to 2014, promotes contemporary glass artists living in Australia and New Zealand
